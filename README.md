# Front-End Development Assessment Template

Congratulations on making it to this stage of our interview process!

The design file below is a Figma document that contains a mobile and desktop layout of the same page. We would like you to take this design and build a responsive, mobile-first static web page. You may implement an existing carousel/slider Javascript solution, but we request that you do not use any jQuery library-dependent solutions. Vanilla JS or React only please.

* Responsiveness
* Efficiency in code, when possible ("Don't Repeat Yourself")
